cs465 full stack development with mean
In my full stack project, I used Express HTML and JavaScript to build traditional interfaces that reload with each request, while single page application (SPA) used JavaScript to update content without reloading. 
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it stores data in flexible documents which made it easier to change data structures. 
JSON stores and transfers data while JaveScript builds functionality on the frontend. 
I refactered the code to simplify repeated logic. 
Methods such as GET, POST and PUT define how data is changed at API endpoinst. 
This course has helped a lot to reach my professional goal of being a web designer. I learnt skills like API design and frontend framework, which will make me a more marketable candidate in my career field.
